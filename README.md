A script to test a 2D panel of neopixel LEDS connected in a serial snake
Works on a 'raspberry pi zero w'. Older models of pi may not work due to the stringent neopixel hardware timing requirements
Each neopixel packfage has a Red,Green and Blue LED, you can specify the size of the pannel eg 20x10 in the code.
